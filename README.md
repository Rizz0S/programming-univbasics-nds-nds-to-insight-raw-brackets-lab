# Construct Insights from an NDS With the `[]`s

## Introduction

In this lab we're going to generate our first insight: how many pieces are in
the vending machine. You're then going to complete a lab where we calculate how
much money the directors' movies made.

To accomplish this, we're going to continue following the processes we
described a few lessons ago:

2. Use [] to verify your understanding from Step 1
  * Print values to verify your understanding
  * Leave code comments and documentation for yourself

The good thing is that there's nothing new to learn here. Based on what we saw
in the NDS, what you know about REPETITION and `Array` syntax, we have all we
need! Let's answer the question: "***How many pieces of snacks are in this vending
machine?***"

## Building on NDS Exploring Code

In the previous lesson we noted that code you write to explore an NDS is rarely
wasted.

```ruby
vm = [[[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}], [{:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Enamel Eaters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}], [{:name=>"Gummy Sour Apple", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}, {:name=>"Gummy Moldy Apple", :pieces=>1}]], [[{:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Orange Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}], [{:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13}, {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}, {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}]]]


row_index = 0
while row_index < vm.length do
  puts "Row #{row_index} has #{vm[row_index]} columns"

  column_index = 0
  while column_index < vm[row_index].length do
    coord = "#{row_index}, #{column_index}"
    inner_len = vm[row_index][column_index].length
    # Remember \t is a TAB character for indentation
    puts "\tCoordinate [#{coord}] points to an #{vm[row_index][column_index].class} of length #{inner_len}"

    inner_index = 0
    while inner_index < inner_len do
      puts "\t\t (#{coord}, #{inner_len}) is: #{vm[row_index][column_index][inner_index]}"
      inner_index += 1
    end

    column_index += 1
  end

  row_index += 1
end
```

```text
Row 0 has [[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}], [{:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Enamel Eaters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}], [{:name=>"Gummy Sour Apple", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}, {:name=>"Gummy Moldy Apple", :pieces=>1}]] columns
	Coordinate [0, 0] points to an Array of length 4
		 (0, 0, 4) is: {:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}
		 (0, 0, 4) is: {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3}
		 (0, 0, 4) is: {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}
		 (0, 0, 4) is: {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}
	Coordinate [0, 1] points to an Array of length 4
		 (0, 1, 4) is: {:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12}
		 (0, 1, 4) is: {:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}
		 (0, 1, 4) is: {:name=>"Enamel Eaters", :pieces=>12}
		 (0, 1, 4) is: {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}
	Coordinate [0, 2] points to an Array of length 3
		 (0, 2, 3) is: {:name=>"Gummy Sour Apple", :pieces=>3}
		 (0, 2, 3) is: {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}
		 (0, 2, 3) is: {:name=>"Gummy Moldy Apple", :pieces=>1}
Row 1 has [[{:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Orange Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}], [{:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13}, {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}, {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}]] columns
	Coordinate [1, 0] points to an Array of length 3
		 (1, 0, 3) is: {:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}
		 (1, 0, 3) is: {:name=>"Orange Drink", :pieces=>1}
		 (1, 0, 3) is: {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}
	Coordinate [1, 1] points to an Array of length 3
		 (1, 1, 3) is: {:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13}
		 (1, 1, 3) is: {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}
		 (1, 1, 3) is: {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}
```

Based on this code and its output, we can slowly step toward a model of how to
get the piece counts we need.

```ruby
require 'pp'

vm = [[[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}], [{:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Enamel Eaters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}], [{:name=>"Gummy Sour Apple", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}, {:name=>"Gummy Moldy Apple", :pieces=>1}]], [[{:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Orange Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}], [{:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13}, {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}, {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}]]]

first_spinner = vm[0][0]
number_of_snacks = first_spinner.length
snack_index = 0
total = 0
while snack_index < number_of_snacks do
  puts first_spinner[snack_index][:pieces]
  total += first_spinner[snack_index][:pieces]
  snack_index += 1
end

puts "On the first spinner there are #{total} pieces of snacks"
pp first_spinner
```

This produces:

```text
3
3
3
3
On the first spinner there are 12 pieces of snacks
[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3},
 {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3},
 {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3},
 {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}]
```

Here we see, thanks to `pp`, that our code to calculate totals worked! We could
say that this code represents _the algorithm_ for calculating the number of
pieces on a spinner.

We can change the code manually to try a different coordinate in the vending
machine to check our logic.

```ruby
require 'pp'

vm = [[[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}], [{:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Enamel Eaters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}], [{:name=>"Gummy Sour Apple", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}, {:name=>"Gummy Moldy Apple", :pieces=>1}]], [[{:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Orange Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}], [{:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13}, {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}, {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}]]]

first_spinner = vm[1][1]
number_of_snacks = first_spinner.length
snack_index = 0
total = 0
while snack_index < number_of_snacks do
  puts first_spinner[snack_index][:pieces]
  total += first_spinner[snack_index][:pieces]
  snack_index += 1
end

puts "On the first spinner there are #{total} pieces of snacks"
pp first_spinner
```

Which returns:

```text
13
1000
99
On the first spinner there are 1112 pieces of snacks
[{:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13},
 {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000},
 {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}]
```

We might, as a last step, add a comment for how to work with the NDS:

```ruby
# vm[row][column][spinner]
# spinner is full of Hashes with keys :pieces and :name
```

With our algorithm and this comment and the NDS exploration code, we can now
determine the total number of pieces:

```ruby
vm = [[[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}], [{:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Enamel Eaters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}], [{:name=>"Gummy Sour Apple", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}, {:name=>"Gummy Moldy Apple", :pieces=>1}]], [[{:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Orange Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}], [{:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13}, {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}, {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}]]]


grand_piece_total = 0
row_index = 0
while row_index < vm.length do
  column_index = 0
  while column_index < vm[row_index].length do
    inner_len = vm[row_index][column_index].length
    inner_index = 0
    while inner_index < inner_len do
      # vm[row][column][spinner]
      # spinner is full of Hashes with keys :pieces and :name
      grand_piece_total += vm[row_index][column_index][inner_index][:pieces]
      inner_index += 1
    end
    column_index += 1
  end
  row_index += 1
end

p grand_piece_total #=> 1192
```

## Lab

In this lab you're going to work through the directors database and create a
`Hash` that records the director's name as a key, and the total grosses of all of their
movies as the value. For example:

```ruby
hash = {
  "1st Director's Name"=>1234567890,
  "2nd Director's Name"=>1234567890,
  "3rd Director's Name"=>1234567890,
  ...
}
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson we used the "raw" or "basic" `Array` and `Hash` methods to
retrieve data out of an NDS. We even wrote a little bit of code to total-up the
number of pieces in the vending machine. Not bad!

But our code is notably lacking any methods. We've not done anything to make
our code _abstract_. The code we've written gets the job done, but all that
`[]` everywhere is hard for human eyes to read. Furthermore, without our
helpful comment that explains:

```ruby
# vm[row][column][spinner]
# spinner is full of Hashes with keys :pieces and :name
```

our code is very hard to read, understand, and maintain. To make this code
better, we'll turn to step three of our process...but that's for another lesson
